## TL;DR

I'm Luke - a software engineer determined to solve every problem collaboratively and elegantly. I firmly believe in the power of simplicity and divergence.

I build modern, scalable systems with predictable APIs and performant UIs.

My primary stack consists of: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Go, GraphQL and PostgreSQL.

## Experience

Over the past 12 years, I have worked at all layers of the software engineering stack; on state-of-the-art React apps, serverless Go APIs, blockchain networks, viral marketing websites, open source tools and a pineapple delivery system. I've worked for early-stage startups, international corporations and infamous advertising agencies. I've also written articles and given talks about some of the things I've discovered along the way.
