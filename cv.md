## TL;DR

I'm Luke - a software engineer determined to solve every problem collaboratively and elegantly. I firmly believe in the power of simplicity and divergence.

I build modern, scalable systems with predictable APIs and performant UIs.

My current stack consists of: JavaScript, React, Node.js, Go, GraphQL and PostgreSQL.
