# Vitae

I'm Luke: love code, love beer and **will code for beer**. I like my code how I like my beer: **finely crafted** with **fresh ingredients** and a **great aftertaste**. My favourite ingredients include **JavaScript**, **ES6**, **SASS**, **Ractive.js** and **Node.js**. You can witness the effect beer has on my code: [Land Rover Accessories](https://accessoriesmatcher.landrover.co.uk/), [Treasure Hunt](https://henhunt.divshot.io/) and [caniuseonmysite](http://caniuseonmysite.com/).

I'm currently working on a couple of side projects: [countr](https://github.com/lukehedger/countr) and (*surprise!*) a site about beer. A few things fascinating me at the moment are **reactive programming**, **ITCSS** and **Diet.js**.
